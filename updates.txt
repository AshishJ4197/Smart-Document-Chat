// Updates and things to check next time

[Done] -> Questions like short and long notes in some particular no. words.
It doesn't give the specified no. of words (it should use outside knowledge if not enough information present or expand tell the text)

// Physics

[Done]-> for the question "What are the laws of reflection?"
the cell 3 section in secondary.py is not selecting the appropriate sentences because of which the highlight is wrong.
But the notebook cell 3 is selecting the right sentences.

[Done]-> Improving the output in cell 2 (For some questions its just pasting direct sentences from the book.)

[Done] // how to handle question which might require both context from book and also general knowledge
such as "Imagine you are a woman participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement. Explain
what the experience meant to your life."

[Done]// in history some ques the cell 4 seems to be cutting off a little too much content
for some questions which are long, it should include more more related points from the book (incase and keywords are there)

// in biology (tried)
[Done] ->also handling mcqs (the way the cell 2 gives final response, and how the cell 3 selects content instead of only the ques where that mcq was asked)

[Later]// reduce the no. of api calls right now its too much

[Done]// cell 4 seems to be removing a little too many s_ids given by cell 3

[Done]// adv vs disadv type of questions

// while integrating using langgraph, ensure if not related to context , it should answer as don't know.
// also we need to give option to go to next shortlist page using an arrow up and down like it works in general pdf highlights.
so that for a long ques when there are highlights in more than one page, the user can easily find the highlighted sentences.


// new upgrades

-> ensure points like (i) (ii) are also highlighted
-> make the logic work for all formulas etc (some have both numerator and denominator etc)

-> update cell 3 so that it doesn't include the unecessary stuff from cell 2 when specified.
