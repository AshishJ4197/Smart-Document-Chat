üîç Reasoning Phase:
FACTS:
- The following are the laws of refraction of light:
- (i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
- (ii) The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for the given pair of media.
- This law is also known as Snell‚Äôs law of refraction.
- If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then, sin i / sin r = constant (9.4)
- This constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.
- The extent of the change in direction that takes place in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index, the ‚Äúconstant‚Äù appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).
- Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2. Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the speed of light in medium 2. The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2.

GLOSSARY:
- i = angle of incidence
- r = angle of refraction
- v1 = speed of light in medium 1
- v2 = speed of light in medium 2

ENTITIES:
- The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
- sin i / sin r = constant, also known as Snell‚Äôs law of refraction.

JUSTIFICATION: The laws of refraction include the coplanarity of the incident ray, refracted ray, and normal, and Snell's law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant.
================================================================================
‚úÖ Final Answer:
The laws of refraction describe how light bends when it passes from one medium to another:

1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface of the two transparent media at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.

2.  Snell‚Äôs Law: The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant for a given color of light and pair of media. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \text{constant}$, where $i$ is the angle of incidence, and $r$ is the angle of refraction. This constant value is the refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first.

**Additional Points:**

*   The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is also given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 ($v_1$) to the speed of light in medium 2 ($v_2$).
*   The extent of bending depends on the refractive index of the two media; a larger refractive index means more bending.

The following are the laws of refraction of light.
 

(i)
The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface
of two transparent media at the point of incidence, all lie in the
same plane.


(ii)


The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of
refraction is a constant, for the light of a given colour and for
the given pair of media.

This law is also known as Snell‚Äôs law of
refraction.

(This is true for angle 0 <

i < 90o)


If i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction, then,
sin

r  = constant
(9.4)


This constant value is called the refractive index of the second medium
with respect to the first.  

Let us study about refractive index in some detail.


9.3.2

The Refractive Index
You have already studied that a ray of light that travels obliquely from
one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the
second medium.

The extent of the change in direction that takes place
in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index,
the ‚Äúconstant‚Äù appearing on the right-hand side of Eq.(9.4).


The refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity,
the relative speed of propagation of light in different media.

It turns
out that light propagates with different speeds in different media.

Light
travels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3√ó108 m s‚Äì1.  

In air, the speed of
light is only marginally less, compared to that in vacuum.

It reduces
considerably in glass or water.

The value of the refractive index for a
given pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media, as
given below.


Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2, as
shown in Fig.9.11.  

Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the
speed of light in medium 2.  

The refractive index of medium 2 with respect
to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and
the speed of light in medium 2.

Light ‚Äì Reflection and Refraction
147
In this Activity, you will note, the light ray has changed its direction
at points O and O‚Ä≤. Note that both the points O and O‚Ä≤ lie on surfaces
separating two transparent media.

Draw a perpendicular NN‚Äô to AB at O
and another perpendicular MM‚Ä≤ to CD at O‚Ä≤.

The light ray at point O has
entered from a rarer medium to a denser medium, that is, from air to
glass.

Note that the light ray has bent towards
the normal.

At O‚Ä≤, the light ray has entered
from glass to air, that is, from a denser
medium to a rarer medium.  

The light here
has bent away from the normal.

Compare the
angle of incidence with the angle of refraction
at both refracting surfaces AB and CD.


In Fig. 9.10, a ray EO is obliquely
incident on surface AB, called incident ray.


OO‚Ä≤ is the refracted ray and O‚Ä≤ H is the
emergent ray.

You may observe that the
emergent ray is parallel to the direction of
the incident ray.

Why does it happen so?

The
extent of bending of the ray of light at the
opposite parallel faces AB (air-glass interface)
and CD (glass-air interface) of the rectangular
glass slab is equal and opposite.

This is why
the ray emerges parallel to the incident ray.


However, the light ray is shifted sideward
slightly.

What happens when a light ray is
incident normally to the interface of two
media?

Try and find out.


Now you are familiar with the refraction of light.

Refraction is due to
change in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to
another.  

Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to
certain laws.
